  ### ADVANCED OPTIONS
  collate: false
  # Instead of directly dropping all drops and xp, some intensive talismans will push to a collated queue.
  # At the end of each tick, the queue will be pushed rather than pushing on every drop creation
  # This will massively improve mining performance on servers, however it is experimental and may not function correctly.
